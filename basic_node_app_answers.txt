What is a Node module?
- A set functions included it in our app. Similar in usage to a JS library.

What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
- While both have the same core function, module.exports should only be used over
exports when we plan for our object to have specific type.
Why is using exports recommended?
- When using module.exports assignment operations will generate  errors in our
app but if we use exports we won't have that issue.
